This project is a Hotel management application used to manage booking rooms, calculating price based on the number of the available rooms and if there is an event.  
The are 2 types of rooms - single beds, and double beds. Employees are informed when they need to go to specific room for clean-up and there is kept recording of that. Data are stored in file, which contains customers informations.  
It is a menu driven program - so it runs until the user exists.  
Every time the program starts, it reads the file to know the previous state of the hotel management.
