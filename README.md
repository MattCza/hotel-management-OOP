Ongoing project  

---

This project is a Hotel Management application designed to streamline the process of room bookings, calculate prices based on room availability and event schedules, and facilitate efficient room management within the hotel.  

Features and Functionalities:  

    Room Booking: The application allows customers to book rooms of two types: single beds and double beds. Customers can specify their preferences and desired dates for their stay.  

    Pricing Calculation: The application automatically calculates the price for each booking based on the availability of rooms and the presence of any ongoing events or promotions. This ensures accurate and consistent pricing for customers.  

    Room Clean-up Notifications: The application provides a feature that alerts hotel employees about specific rooms that require clean-up. This ensures timely and efficient room maintenance and cleanliness.  

    Data Storage and Management: All customer information, including booking details, is stored in a file for easy retrieval and management. This file maintains a record of customer data to enable seamless continuity and historical reference.  

    Menu-Driven Interface: The application is menu-driven, allowing users to interact with the program through a series of intuitive menus. Users can navigate the various features and functionalities easily.  

    State Persistence: Upon each program start, the application reads the stored file to retrieve the previous state of the hotel management. This allows the application to resume from the point where it was left off, ensuring no data or booking information is lost.  

The Hotel Management application provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for hotel staff and customers alike. By automating room bookings, calculating accurate prices, managing room cleanliness, and maintaining customer data, it optimizes the hotel's operations and enhances the overall guest experience.
